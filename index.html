        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I love coding because it really excites me, it is fun to do. It really excites me whenever I come across a problem, I get curious about solving it. I am a person who loves to solve puzzles, questions involving logic and thinking ability.
            <br>
            (1) It helps me automate some of my daily and simple tasks. If I have to do something repeatedly, I will prefer to code it and then run that code again and again.
            <br>
            (2) It is really interesting and fun activity to do. Imagine creating a solution to a problem that can be used by people to make their work easy.
            <br>
            (3) I am person who loves puzzles and problems involving logic. I can be seen playing Arcade or Puzzle category games in my free time.
            <br>
            (4) You can create something that can be extremely useful to people that can make their life and work easier.
            <br>
            (5) I love that feeling you get when your solution gets an AC in some contest.
            <br>
            I extremely love programming and I do mean extremely.
